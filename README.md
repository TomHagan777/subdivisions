            Extracting image data and reducing it with larger modules of sampled information for 
            creative manipulation, nothing is added, only removed.

            Similar to how a distortion effect affects audio signals; degrading and downsampling 
            the signal for novel and creative output, this takes an image and downsamples the data 
            for a controlled demolition of image; from something representational all the way to 
            complete abstraction.

            Pixelation is nothing new and hardly anything to write home about, but what 
            this proves to be is a unique type of layered pixelation, an exploration and 
            study in reduction and representation, gestalt theory, and modular graphics.

            As we reduce and remove in form, colour, and content, it transforms until the 
            original transmission of representative image is lost, and something else entirely 
            novel is left in its place â€“ even though technically, all the same image data is 
            present.
